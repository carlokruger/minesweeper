# Minesweeper

## Stage 1/5: Minesweeper is loading...
### Description

Welcome to the first stage! You have a default React app, which was generated by the command ```npx create-react-app appName```. To get comfortable with the structure of the React project, modify the code so that the app shows that Minesweeper is loading.

Figure out how to change the text and the picture on the page, then put up the text "Minesweeper is loading...", and replace the React logo with something more suitable, like a picture of a [bomb](https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/360753/bomb.svg). Don’t break the rotation of the picture and make sure that there's no other text on the page. Finally, change the font of the text: you can choose anything you like from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

After completing the first stage, you can open the app in your browser and admire the beautiful loading page with an infinitely rotating picture!

Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the ```npm start``` command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use ```Ctrl+C```.

### Objectives
* Change the React logo to another picture
* Add the text "Minesweeper is loading..."
* Change the font

### Examples
In a browser, the result of this step will look something like this:

## Stage 2/5: Are you a designer?
### Description
In this stage, you are going to create all the components of the game. Don’t be scared: here, you will be working only on the visuals! Before you get to work, make sure that you know how to create functional components and use props: you may consult the [React library official website](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) if you need to learn or refresh something. Your task is to decide how to break down the game into parts, that is, the components of your app, then use JSX to describe it, and make the game look nice.

Let’s think about what elements we need in our game. First of all, you need a playing field: let it contain 8 columns and 9 rows. Position the cells to form straight rows and columns: give a className to the whole field and className=”cell” to all cells, then you can easily position them with display flex. Note: since there are a lot of similar objects, it’s better to use map() instead of hard code. Check out an [article on lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) to learn how to do it.

Remember, the player needs to find all the mines to win the game, so let's make a flag counter that will keep track of the remaining unflagged mines. At the beginning of the game, there are 10 unflagged mines.

Following the original version of Minesweeper, let's also add a reset button and a timer. Don't forget that when the game hasn’t started yet, the timer should show 0:00. The reset button should be the only element on which the cursor changes into a pointer.

Great, we have listed the elements of the game! The app should also have a [component hierarchy](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html): figure out which components will determine the content of others and how you will pass props. You can decide on the structure by yourself, or use the recommended plan:

The final touch is to add the name "Minesweeper” and improve the game's looks by styling it. For example, you can put a picture near the name and play with colors. Flex your imagination and be creative!

As a result, you’ll see the Minesweeper game that does not work... for now.

Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the ```npm start``` command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use ```Ctrl+C```.

### Objectives
1. Implement components:
    * Field 8x9
    * Flag counter equal to 10
    * Reset button
    * Timer at 0:00
    * Components and the hierarchy
2. Add CSS

### Examples
In a browser, the result of this step will look something like this:
