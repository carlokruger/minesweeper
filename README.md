# Minesweeper

## Stage 1/5: Minesweeper is loading...
### Description

Welcome to the first stage! You have a default React app, which was generated by the command ```npx create-react-app appName```. To get comfortable with the structure of the React project, modify the code so that the app shows that Minesweeper is loading.

Figure out how to change the text and the picture on the page, then put up the text "Minesweeper is loading...", and replace the React logo with something more suitable, like a picture of a [bomb](https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/360753/bomb.svg). Donâ€™t break the rotation of the picture and make sure that there's no other text on the page. Finally, change the font of the text: you can choose anything you like from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

After completing the first stage, you can open the app in your browser and admire the beautiful loading page with an infinitely rotating picture!

Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the ```npm start``` command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use ```Ctrl+C```.
